## Analytical Geometry Repo

This repository contains a program, developed by students of the first semester of Computer Sciences at UNICAMP, that performs some of the subjects studied in the matter of Analytical Geometry, and it's developed in the language studied simultaneously, in the programming matter.

### Some functions we expect it to have

Here are some functionalities we expect our program to be able to execute

```markdown
**Given the equations of a system**

- Create the n-dimensional array containing the coefficients of the system
- Find the reduced staggered matrix using Gauss-Jordan method
- Solve the system (also informing whether it is and undetermined possible system or impossible system)


**Given the values of a matrix**

- Find the reverse matrix
- Calculate that matrix determinant
```

### Purpose

This project will be kinda fun and also can help us to learn AG and Python
